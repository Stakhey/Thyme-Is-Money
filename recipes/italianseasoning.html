    <h2>Description</h2>  
    <p>There are dozens of foods which are made better by Italian seasoning, so if you love to cook, you’ve probably often used this blend of Mediterranean herbs. It’s a mix of 5 herbs and comes together in minutes. It’s a great way to use up odds and ends from your spice collection, and it makes lovely DIY gifts too. Use it to season fish and veggies, or simply sprinkle on olive oil and use as a dip for bread. You can store your homemade Italian seasoning mix in an airtight container for 6 months to 1 year. Of course, it’s best when it’s the freshest! Suprisingly, Italian seasoning isn’t used in Italian cuisine! There’s no official “definition” of it, either. It’s a spice blend that was created as a convenience for cooks to quickly add Mediterranean flair to dishes. Most mixes you’ll find at the store contain similar herbs: oregano, basil, and thyme being the heavy hitters.</p>
